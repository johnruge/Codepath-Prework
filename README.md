## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Youtube
- the way it keeps track of the videos I have watched as well as those I have not finished.
- I may just use youtube even without signing in.

Instagram
- it allows one to delete/unsend messages no matter how long ago it was sent.
- Ability to use threads without a need to create a new account.

LinkedIn
- Information about the people who viewed one's profile.
- Being able to see people's posts that people in my network commented.

- I look forward to creating an app that may update and inform students about the new internship releases as well as reminders of the deadlines.

Some ideas to improve the app:
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Iplement a way to change the color of the text as well




## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Familiarizing with the xcode was quite a journey but with instructions it became quite smoother.
